## Structure of the repository


The folder Cheatsheet stores some R and SQL cheat sheets.

The data folder stores all data sets used in the lecture notes.  Each original lecture slide file is in its own folder. You may need to update the path in the lecture slides to import a data set to the R workspace depending on the relative path of the data folder to your workspace. 

The file MyNorthwind.pbix is a dashboard for the NorthWind_Database in Power BI.
